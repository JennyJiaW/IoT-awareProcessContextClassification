# Technical Report: Literature Search Details Across Three Iterations
## Introduction

This report documents the literature search process undertaken as part of our method to identify and review relevant works for this study. The search was conducted in three iterative stages, each with a specific objective tailored to address distinct aspects of the research focus. A detailed explanation of each iteration is presented in the following sections.

## Iterative Literature Search Process

### Iteration 1

The primary objective of the first iteration was to synthesise insights from existing literature on process context classifications. In this phase, we focused on identifying literature addressing context classifications related to business processes. As a starting point, we selected the paper: *Process Mining Put into Context* (van der Aalst & Dustdar, 2012) and applied the backward and forward snowballing technique (Webster & Watson, 2002) to discover additional relevant works.

Through this process, we identified a total of 102 papers across two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. To ensure the relevance and quality of selected studies, the following exclusion criteria were applied:

**EC1**: Articles inaccessible for review or <br />
**EC2**: Articles not written in English or <br />
**EC3**: Articles not peer-reviewed or <br />
**EC4**: Articles that do not propose a novel process context classification

After applying these criteria, only seven studies were relevant. These studies proposed novel classifications of process contexts, which serve as the basis for subsequent iterations.

### Iteration 2

The objective of the second iteration was to enrich the classification by incorporating theoretical foundations from the context classifications in the IoT domain. In this phase, we concentrated on exploring existing classifications and ontologies related to IoT contexts. As a starting point, we selected three recent systematic literature reviews on context-aware IoT systems and employed the backward and forward snowballing method to identify further relevant works:

1. *Context-aware computing, learning, and big data in Internet of Things: A survey* (Sezer et al., 2018)
2. *The MOM of context-aware systems: A survey* (Pradeep & Krishnamoorthy, 2019)
3. *Leveraging context-awareness for internet of things ecosystem: Representation, organization, and management of context* (Pradeep et al., 2021)

This iteration yielded 369 relevant papers from Scopus and Web of Science. The following exclusion criteria were applied to refine the selection:

**EC1**: Articles inaccessible for review or <br />
**EC2**: Articles not written in English or <br />
**EC3**: Articles not peer-reviewed or <br />
**EC4**: Articles discussing applications based on existing IoT classifications or <br />
**EC5**: Articles that do not propose new IoT classifications or <br />
**EC6**: Articles that do not propose new IoT ontologies <br />

Using these criteria, we identified 30 relevant publications that introduced novel IoT context classifications or contributed to the conceptualization of IoT ontologies.

### Iteration 3

The goal of the third iteration was to assess whether the proposed classification satisfied the predefined ending conditions with use cases found in existing literature. Thus, in the third iteration, we aimed to identify existing use cases that apply IoT to business processes. To ensure comprehensive coverage, we conducted a systematic search targeting use cases that explore IoT-aware business processes, encompassing both business process management and the Internet of Things domain. The search query employed (Fig. 1) was adapted from prior research conducting a systematic literature review on IoT-aware business process modelling (Compagnucci et al., 2023). 

**Key Details:**
- **Search Query Terms:** See Fig. 1 in the full report
- **Databases:** Scopus and Web of Science
- **Publication Criteria:** Peer-reviewed, English language, published in 2013 or later
- **Exclusion Criteria:**
  - EC1: Lacks a use case
  - EC2: Use case does not outline a business process
  - EC3: Use case does not apply IoT technology
  - EC4: Study does not apply IoT technology to improve the business process
- **Inclusion Criteria:**
  - IC1: Provides detailed information about the business process
  - IC2: Details IoT entities involved in the process
  - IC3: Depicts interactions between IoT entities and business processes

**Results:** 
- **Initial Studies Identified:** 1103
- **Filtered Studies:** 246
- **Final Selection:** 61 use cases after reviewing and removing redundancies
