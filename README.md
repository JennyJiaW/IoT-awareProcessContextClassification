# Incorporating IoT Contexts into Business Processes: A Contextual Classification

In this work, we apply the method proposed by Nickerson et al.(2013) to develop the IoT-aware process context classification. In total, we went through three iterations of the method. For the first two iterations, we adopted the _conceptual-to-empirical_ method to synthesise insights from the literature on process and IoT context classifications. In the third iteration, we assessed the classification derived from the previous two iterations as part of the development phase, carrying out the _empirical-to-conceptual_ approach. This iteration involves assessing whether the proposed classification satisfies the predefined ending conditions with use cases from existing literature. Finally, we performed an evaluation of the assessed classification using real-world use cases. These iterations are illustrated in Fig.1, and detailed information about the literature search conducted across the three iterations can be found in [Technial Report](TechnicalReport.md).
